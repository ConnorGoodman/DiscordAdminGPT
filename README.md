# Discord Bot with OpenAI GPT-3.5

This is a Discord bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to check if messages follow server rules. The bot is built with Python and uses the `discord.py` library to interact with the Discord API.

## Getting Started

To get started with the bot, you'll need to do the following:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following environment variables:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your-discord-bot-token>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
DISCORD_RULES=<your-discord-server-rules>
```

Replace `<your-discord-bot-token>` with your Discord bot token, `<your-openai-api-key>` with your OpenAI API key, and `<your-discord-server-rules>` with your Discord server rules.

An example of DISCORD_RULES is: `"1. No swearing 2. No toxic behavior 3. No NSFW content`
4. Run the bot with the command `python main.py`.

## Usage

Once the bot is running, it will automatically check messages in your Discord server to see if they follow your server rules. If a message does not follow the rules, the bot will respond with a message explaining why.

You can also mention the bot in a message to chat with it using OpenAI's GPT-3. The bot will respond with a message generated by GPT-3 based on your input.
